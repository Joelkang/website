My favorite subject of inquiry is **interfaces**. Until we crack mind reading and
time travel, everything we do as human beings is mediated through some type of
interface.

Ideas are communicated through the interface of language, and every door, button
and symbol is an interface--whether digital or physical--between two otherwise
independent systems. Interfaces tell us what we can and cannot do, but they're
often lossy representations of what goes on behind the scenes.

Every day, we evolve and adapt our mental models of how the world works by
poking, prodding and interrogating the interfaces that exist all around us.

This mental model is the **context** with which we go about our lives. I'm
frequently amazed by how no two people have exactly the same context, and yet
through well designed interfaces, we've built entire civilisations that span
time and space. Everyone knows that Context is King, but nobody can actually say
what kind of crown Context wears.

My professional project so far, has been to tease apart the interfaces of context,
where I've been building digital tools for knowledge workers to gain confidence
through context.

I'm currently a Product Engineer at [Maihem](https://maihem.ai), researching the
interface between the probabilistic nature of AI models and the demand for
rigour of AI-powered systems.

I grew up in Singapore, spent my 20s in the San Francisco Bay Area and New York
City, and currently call London home.

Welcome aboard my context spaceship, let's see what interfaces we bump into
along the way. ðŸ›¸
