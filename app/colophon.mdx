My favorite subject of inquiry is **interfaces**. Ever since I seeing [Captain
Janeway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Voyager) instantiate a cup of
coffee with her voice, I've been obsessed with how we interact with the world
around us: everything we do as human beings is mediated through some type of
interface.

Ideas are communicated through the interface of language, and every door, button
and symbol is an interface--whether digital or physical--designed to bridge two
otherwise independent systems. Interfaces tell us what we can and cannot do, but
they're often lossy representations of what is
[phenomenologically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy))
possible.

Every day, we evolve and adapt our mental models of how the world works by
poking and prodding the interfaces that we encounter every day.

This mental model is the **context** with which we understand our lived
experiences. It frequently bewilders me that even though no two people have
exactly the same context, we've built entire civilisations across time and space
by designing functional and beautiful interfaces. _Everyone knows that Context
is King, but nobody can actually say what kind of crown Context wears._

My academic and professional projects so far, have been to tease apart the
interfaces of context, through language, semiotics and, more recently, at the  
interface between humans and computers. 

How can we shape and manipulate digital tools so that we can gain more context,
and through that, more confidence in our work, our lives, and ourselves?

Currently, I'm a Product Engineer at [Maihem](https://maihem.com), where I'm
helping to carve out the interface between probabilistic AI models, and the
demand for rigour of AI-powered systems.

I grew up in Singapore, where I started this exploration through linguistics.
Finishing my degree in Cognitive Science in Providence, Rhode Island, I then
moved to the San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, and currently call London
home.

Welcome aboard my context spaceship, let's see what interfaces we bump into
along the way. ðŸ›¸
