# Dala

I founded Dala in 2021 as a Context as a Service platform. The goal was to help
knowledge workers gain confidence in their work through context. We believe that
context is gained from pushing and pulling knowledge from your company's
knowledge base.

We bet on the idea that it was more productive to be a System of Intelligence
that sat on top of your Systems of Record rather than being yet another place
where knowledge went to die.

While other companies were trying to build One App to Rule them All, we believed
in letting your data stay where it is most suited for the task (JTBD) it was
created for, and instead Dala would do the hard work of connecting the dots for
you.

In 2024, after not making enough inroads on product market fit, I closed Dala to
pursue other avenues.
